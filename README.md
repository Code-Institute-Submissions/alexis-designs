##Introduction

Alexis Designs in a online commercial website, intending to display and advertise the products created by Alexis Designs, a company that handcrafts clothing, quilts and other small person items using batiks. Batik is a traditional Malaysian and Indonesian fabric.
The webiste includes a title page, three main pages that contains content, About, Products, Contact, and two secondary pages which can only be reached through links found in the primary pages.
The website has been designed to allow visitors to primarily browse the products offered by Alexis Designs, and then contact the company if they wish to purchase a product. The visitor is currently unable to purchase items directly from the website.
Furthermore, visitors are able to find external links to social media platforms, such as Instagram or Facebook, as well as read an updated list on where Alexis Designs will be in person to display products.
Thirdly, any interested party can learn a little about Alexis, of Alexis Designs, and a brief introduction about the material, Batik.

The webiste has been designed on a desktop computer, at resolution 1024 x 768, however it has been designed with other devices in mind, providing different layouts and components. However, the user experience is expected to be consistent for all users regardless of the device that they are using.
Additionally, to encourage traffic to the website and to boost sales, the website has been designed to streamline users to their desired destination. To allow easier navigation, a menu will always be visible for the user.

##Technologies

There were several libraries that helped create this website. Most noticably are the components found over several pages, such as the carousels and modal windows.

###Libraries

Bootstrap 4 - The carousels and modal windows were sourced from Bootstrap. I imported the original components, and then modified them as required. Some styles were adjusted in style.css, generally, colouring and sizes. 

Font Awesome - The icons used in the social media links were sourced from Font Awesome.

Google Fonts - The two fonts used, Monserrat and Gotu are sourced from Google's font library.

CSS Hover - I used the stylings from this website to decorate links found throught the website, in particular I used 'Underline Reveal' for directory links.

###Additonal resources

W3Schools - While no code was sourced from this website, I relied on troubleshooting any difficulties I had on this website.

Encycolorpedia - This website was able to further develop a colour palette.
